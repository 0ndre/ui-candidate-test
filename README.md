This is the candaidate test for ExactTarget UI developers. 

## Here are the guidelines for the test:
+ Fork this repository, do your work, commit often with descriptive messages. When finished, send a pull request.
+ The HTML files have a series of questions/tasks in them.
+ You may use any JavaScript and/or CSS library you wish, or none at all.
+ You may use an external or inline JavaScript file(s).
+ You may take as long as you like to complete the coding challenges.
+ Filenames must remain the same as in the original repository.
+ testdata.txt contains the data your code will be run against. You may use it as you wish in your code and/or testing.
+ For browsers, your code should run without errors on the latest of the major browsers.
+ You get to define 'latest' and 'major', but be prepared to defend your choices.
+ Yes, you MUST include IE, but only 8 or higher.
+ If you really want to geek out, include a meta.txt file that includes the following information:

    TotalTime: HHmm
    
    BrowserTesting: Browser.name Browser.version etc
    
    UnitTest: relative path to your own unit test suite
